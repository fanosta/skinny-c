\section using_ctr CTR mode

The API for Skinny-C provides CTR mode for bulk encryption of
arbitrarily-sized data blocks.  The first step is to initialize the
CTR control structure with the key.  For this example we will
use a 256-bit key with Skinny128:

\code
Skinny128CTR_t ctr;
unsigned char key[32] = ...;
skinny128_ctr_init(&ctr);
skinny128_ctr_set_key(&ctr, key, 32);
\endcode

The skinny128_ctr_init() function chooses the best CTR mode implementation
for your platform at runtime.  For example, the AVX2 backend will be used
if your CPU supports AVX2 and the library was compiled with AVX2 support
enabled.

The next step is to set the counter value for the current data block.
Counter values are typically formed by combining a packet sequence
number with an offset into the packet.  It is very important that
the counter values be different from one packet to the next.

The following is an example of setting the initial counter value
based on a 32-bit packet sequence number:

\code
uint32_t seqnum = ...;
unsigned char counter[16];
memset(counter, 0, sizeof(counter));
counter[0] = (unsigned char)(seqnum >> 24);
counter[1] = (unsigned char)(seqnum >> 16);
counter[2] = (unsigned char)(seqnum >> 8);
counter[3] = (unsigned char)seqnum;
skinny128_ctr_set_counter(&ctr, counter, sizeof(counter));
\endcode

The bytes at the end of the counter value will be incremented each
time CTR mode needs a new 128-bit block of encrypted data.  In this
example there are 12 bytes available for incrementing.

If your application processes large amounts of data, then there is a
risk that the sequence number might roll around.  If this is the case,
then you should use a 64-bit sequence number, or abort the connection
when the sequence number rolls around, or both.

Encryption of packets is accomplished as follows:

\code
unsigned char packet[MAX_PACKET_SIZE] = ...;
skinny128_ctr_encrypt(packet, packet, size, &ctr);
\endcode

The first two parameters are the output buffer for the ciphertext and
the input buffer for the plaintext.  In this example we are encrypting
the data in-place within the same buffer but they can be different.

To encrypt the next packet, increment the sequence number and then
call skinny128_ctr_set_counter() and skinny128_ctr_encrypt() again.

In CTR mode, decryption and encryption are identical operations, so there
is no "decrypt" function in the CTR API.  Use skinny128_ctr_encrypt().

Once you have finished encrypting all packets, you should clean up
the CTR control structure to free any dyanmically-allocated memory
that was allocated by skinny128_ctr_init():

\code
skinny128_ctr_cleanup(&ctr);
\endcode

\section using_ctr_tweak CTR mode with per-packet tweaks

SKINNY is a tweakable block cipher, so it is possible to encrypt packets
with CTR mode in a slightly different way.  Instead of passing the sequence
number in as part of the counter block, the sequence number can be
provided as a per-packet tweak.

This is definitely useful when encrypting packets with Skinny64 or Mantis
as the 64-bit counter value is not large enough to contain both a 64-bit
sequence number and a packet offset.

As before, we start by initializing the 128-bit key and the CTR
control structure with Skinny64:

\code
Skinny64CTR_t ctr;
unsigned char key[16] = ...;
skinny64_ctr_init(&ctr);
skinny64_ctr_set_tweaked_key(&ctr, key, 16);
\endcode

For each packet, the sequence number is provided as the tweak and the
counter value is reset to all-zeroes:

\code
uint64_t seqnum = ...;
unsigned char seqbuf[8];
seqbuf[0] = (unsigned char)(seqnum >> 56);
seqbuf[1] = (unsigned char)(seqnum >> 48);
seqbuf[2] = (unsigned char)(seqnum >> 40);
seqbuf[3] = (unsigned char)(seqnum >> 32);
seqbuf[4] = (unsigned char)(seqnum >> 24);
seqbuf[5] = (unsigned char)(seqnum >> 16);
seqbuf[6] = (unsigned char)(seqnum >> 8);
seqbuf[7] = (unsigned char)seqnum;
skinny64_ctr_set_tweak(&ctr, seqbuf, sizeof(seqbuf));
skinny64_ctr_set_counter(&ctr, NULL, 0);
\endcode

Packet encryption is similar to before:

\code
unsigned char packet[MAX_PACKET_SIZE] = ...;
skinny64_ctr_encrypt(packet, packet, size, &ctr);
\endcode

Finally, clean up when the session ends:

\code
skinny64_ctr_cleanup(&ctr);
\endcode

\section using_ecb ECB mode

\note ECB mode can be unsafe when used to directly encrypt bulk data
if you don't know what you are doing.  Applications should use
higher-level modes such as CTR, CBC, EAX, GCM, etc when handling
bulk data.  Failure to do this may compromise the security of
the application.

The API for Skinny-C provides ECB encryption on a block-by-block basis.
The first step is to initialize the key schedule using the key.
For this example we will use a 256-bit key with Skinny128:

\code
Skinny128Key_t ks;
unsigned char key[32] = ...;
skinny128_set_key(&ks, key, 32);
\endcode

Each block of the plaintext is then encrypted as follows:

\code
unsigned char plaintext[16] = ...;
unsigned char ciphertext[16];
skinny128_ecb_encrypt(ciphertext, plaintext, &ks);
\endcode

To decrypt a ciphertext back to the original plaintext:

\code
unsigned char ciphertext[16] = ...;
unsigned char plaintext[16];
skinny128_ecb_decrypt(plaintext, ciphertext, &ks);
\endcode

\section using_parallel_ecb Parallel ECB mode

The API for Skinny-C provides an alternative ECB interface that
encrypts multiple blocks in parallel on platforms that have
SIMD instruction support.  This can be useful for implementing block
cipher modes like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCB_mode">OCB</a>
that operate on blocks in parallel.

\note \ref using_ctr "CTR mode" also encrypts multiple blocks in parallel
when SIMD support is available.  There is dedicated support for CTR mode
in the library so it isn't necessary to use the parallel ECB API for CTR.

To perform parallel encryption, we start by initializing the parallel
ECB context and then set the key:

\code
Skinny128ParallelECB_t ecb;
unsigned char key[32] = ...;
skinny128_parallel_ecb_init(&ecb);
skinny128_parallel_ecb_set_key(&ecb, key, 32);
\endcode

The skinny128_parallel_ecb_init() function chooses the best parallel ECB
implementation for your platform at runtime.  For example, the AVX2 backend
will be used if your CPU supports AVX2 and the library was compiled with
AVX2 support enabled.

Encryption of eight blocks at a time is accomplished as follows
(decryption is similar):

\code
unsigned char blocks[8 * SKINNY128_BLOCK_SIZE] = ...;
skinny128_parallel_ecb_encrypt(blocks, blocks, sizeof(blocks), &ecb);
\endcode

The first two parameters are the output buffer for the ciphertext and
the input buffer for the plaintext.  In this example we are encrypting
the data in-place within the same buffer but they can be different.

The amount of parallelism is dependent upon the specific back end
implementation.  The best parallel block size (in bytes) is given
by <tt>ecb.parallel_size</tt>.  This can be used to tune the parallel
block size at runtime.

Once you have finished encrypting or decrypting data, you should clean
up the parallel ECB control structure to free any dyanmically-allocated
memory that was allocated by skinny128_parallel_ecb_init():

\code
skinny128_parallel_ecb_cleanup(&ecb);
\endcode
