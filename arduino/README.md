Skinny-C for Arduino
====================

This directory contains an implementation of the SKINNY family of tweakable
block ciphers using the framework of Rhys Weatherley's
[cryptography library](http://rweather.github.com/arduinolibs/crypto.html)
library for Arduino on [github](https://github.com/rweather/arduinolibs).

To install this library, copy the contents of the "libraries/Skinny"
directory to "sketchbook/libraries/Skinny" on your system.  You should
then be able to load and compile the examples from within the Arudino IDE.

For more information on this code, to report bugs, or to suggest
improvements, please contact the author Rhys Weatherley via
